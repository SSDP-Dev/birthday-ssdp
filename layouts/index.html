        <p>Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Those great big fluffy clouds. Just make a decision and let it go. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Very easy to work these to death.</p>

        <p>Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down.</p>

        <p>How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. What the devil. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Son of a gun. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain.</p>
