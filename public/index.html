      <h1>SSDP is turning 20</h1>
      <p class="lead">Join us in our birthday celebrations!</p>

      <p>SSDP Birthday Parties are fundraisers to celebrate 20 years of SSDP! In 1998, a few dozen students who had been chatting online became the first to call themselves Students for Sensible Drug Policy. Since then, we’ve mobilized tens of thousands
        of young people to advocate for a more sensible approach to drugs, the people who use them, and the policies around them. </p>

      <p>Join our global network of students, alumni, and supporters in celebration of 20 years of student-led drug policy reform by hosting a Birthday Party to celebrate and benefit SSDP. An SSDP Birthday Party can be a party of your design, whether it’s
        potluck, a dance party, or a gathering of your chapter members to celebrate a recent victory. You can host a party regardless of whether you’re a student, alumnus, or supporter. Everyone is invited to help celebrate SSDP’s birthday!</p>

      <p><h5>It’s not just a party. </h5></p>
      <p>SSDP Birthday Party hosts can create lasting change through these events. </p>
      <ul>
      <li>Support our student members in their efforts to change policy, educate communities, and reduce harm</li>
      <li>Take part in a global fundraising campaign that will give SSDP a strong start to the 2018-19 school year</li>
      <li>Celebrate 20 years of student influence in drug policy reform</li>
      <li>Introduce your friends and community to SSDP and our movement</li>
      <li>Have fun while doing good!</li>
    </ul>

      <p><h5>You can win prizes for hosting a party! </h5></p>
      <p>The student chapter that raises the most money for SSDP will win one free #SSDP2019 registration plus a visit to your chapter from Betty Aldworth. All chapters who host parties earn 1 CAT point per $10 raised. </p>

      <p>The non-student host who raises the most money for SSDP will win one free registration to #SSDP2019. The party with the most Alumni Association members present will win a package of vintage SSDP swag.</p>

      <p>Anyone who raises more than $1,000 at their party wins an SSDP t-shirt and entry into a raffle for awesome prizes like a pair of tickets to the <u>National Cannabis Festival</u>.</p>

      <p><h5>Where’s the party? And when?</h5></p>
      <p>SSDP Birthday Parties will take place in cities and towns across the United States, and even in some other countries! A directory of events will be published on our website in August. SSDP’s official 20th birthday will be October 1, 2018, so parties
        will take place throughout September and October.</p>

      <p><h5>How much are we trying to raise? How much should I try to raise?</h5></p>
      <p>Our birthday party series will raise $100,000 to support student efforts to end the War on Drugs. We’d like for SSDP supporters to host events with the potential to raise about $5,000. Students who want to host birthday parties and raise money from
        their community can aim for about $500. Remember, chapters can earn 1 CAT point for every $10 they raise-- you can help raise money for SSDP and earn points along the way!</p>
